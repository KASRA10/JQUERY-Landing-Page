## 📌 What is jQuery?

**jQuery** is a popular open-source JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It was created to make JavaScript programming easier and more accessible, especially for beginners.

## ❓ Why Use jQuery?

- ✅ **Simplifies JavaScript**: jQuery provides easy-to-use syntax for common tasks like selecting elements, handling events, and making AJAX calls.
- ✅ **Cross-browser Compatibility**: jQuery smooths out inconsistencies between browsers so your code works reliably across platforms.
- ✅ **Rich Plugin Ecosystem**: Thousands of plugins are available to extend jQuery’s functionality.
- ✅ **Quick Prototyping**: Ideal for rapid development and testing of interactive features.

## 🛠️ How to Use jQuery

1. **Include jQuery in your HTML file**  
   You can use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or download the jQuery file locally.

   **Using CDN:**
   ```html
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
   ```

   **Using Local File:**
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/jquery.min.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Write jQuery Code**
   ```javascript
   $(document).ready(function() {
     $('button').click(function() {
       alert('Button clicked!');
     });
   });
   ```

## 📚 What is a Library?

A **library** in programming is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks. Libraries help reduce development time and improve code reliability by offering tested and reusable functions.

---

## 📦 What is a JavaScript Library?

A **JavaScript library** is a set of JavaScript functions and objects that simplify web development. Instead of writing everything from scratch, developers use libraries like jQuery, React, or Lodash to build interactive and efficient web applications faster.

## 🚀 Features Implemented with jQuery

### 🔄 Preloader
A **preloader** is a visual loading animation that appears before the full content of the page is ready. It enhances user experience by indicating that something is happening behind the scenes.

### 🎞️ Slider
A **slider** (or carousel) displays multiple images or content panels in a rotating fashion. jQuery makes it easy to animate transitions and add interactive controls.

### ❓ FAQ Schema
An **FAQ section** powered by jQuery allows users to expand/collapse answers dynamically. This improves readability and keeps the layout clean.
